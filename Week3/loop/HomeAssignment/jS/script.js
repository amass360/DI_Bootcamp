// Part I - Review About Arrays
// Write code to remove ‚ÄúGreg‚Äù from the people array.
const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];
people.splice(0,1)
// Write code to replace ‚ÄúJames‚Äù to ‚ÄúJason‚Äù.
people.splice(2,1,"jason")
// Write code to add your name to the end of the people array.
people.push("Aaron")
console.log(people)
// Write code that console.logs Mary‚Äôs index. take a look at the indexOf method on Google.
console.log(people.indexOf('Mary'))
// Write code to make a copy of the people array using the slice method.
// The copy should NOT include ‚ÄúMary‚Äù or your name.
// Hint: remember that now the people array should look like this const people = ["Mary", "Devon", "Jason", "Yourname"];
// Hint: Check out the documentation for the slice method
console.log(people.slice(0,3))
// Write code that gives the index of ‚ÄúFoo‚Äù. Why does it return -1 ?
console.log(people.indexOf('Foo'))
//RETURNS -1 IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT IT IS AN INVALID INDEX IN THE STRING
console.log(people)
// Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.
// Hint: What is the relationship between the index of the last element in the array and the length of the array?
var last = people[people.length-1]

// Part II - Loops
// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and console.log each person.
for (let i=0; i<people.length; i++) {
    console.log(people[i])
}
// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and exit the loop after you console.log ‚ÄúDevon‚Äù .
// Hint: take a look at the break statement in the lesson.
for (let i=0; i<people.length; i++) {
    console.log(people[i]);
    if (people[i]==='Devon') {
        break;
    }
}

// üåü Exercise 2 : Your Favorite Colors
// Instructions
// Create an array called colors where the value is a list of your five favorite colors.
// Loop through the array and as you loop console.log a string like so: ‚ÄúMy #1 choice is blue‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy #2 choice is red‚Äù ect‚Ä¶ .
// Bonus: Change it to console.log ‚ÄúMy 1st choice‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy 2nd choice‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy 3rd choice‚Äù, picking the correct suffix for each number.
// Hint : create an array of suffixes to do the Bonus
const colors = ["blue", "green", "black", "grey"]
const suffixes = ["st", "nd", "rd", "th"]
for (let i=0; i<4; i++) {
    console.log("My ", i+1,(suffixes[i]),  " choice is ", (colors[i]))
}

// üåü Exercise 3 : Repeat The Question
// Instructions
// Prompt the user for a number.
// Hint : Check the data type you receive from the prompt (ie. Use the typeof method)
prompt('enter a number')
console.log(typeof(prompt))
// While the number is smaller than 10 continue asking the user for a new number.
// Tip : Which while loop is more relevant for this situation?
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log("What is your new number? -->" + i)
  i++;

// üåü Exercise 5 : Family
// Instructions
// Create an object called family with a few key value pairs.

// Using a for in loop, console.log the values of the object.
