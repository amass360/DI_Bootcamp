                    <span>Hello my name is Aaron Massoth.</span>
                    As a Technical Support Engineer at Qualtero, I work with a plethora of airlines and government airforces, such as United, NetJets, British Airways, Canadian Airforce, IDF, NASA, and U.S. Airforce, to provide technical support for their pilot training platform and manage their database of information. I enjoy applying my skills and knowledge in digital forensics, which I obtained from my Bachelor of Science degree at the University at Albany, SUNY, to solve complex and challenging technical issues that our clients encounter while using our software.
                    Within the scope of my role, I heavily utilize various database applications and operating systems, including MySQL, Virtual Machines, PowerShell, and API Scripting. I also collaborate with the development team to communicate feedback, suggestions, and bug reports from the clients, and to test new features and updates before they are released. I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute to the improvement and innovation of our software, and to support the training and development of pilots and military personnel.
